I’m a Junior at Brown University studying Computer Science and International and Public Affairs. I’m two years deep into my Computer Science journey, and I can’t wait to keep programming, designing, and creating! So far, I have had the pleasure to be an undergraduate teaching assistant for Brown’s CS Department and teach youth introductory CS concepts through the Boys & Girls Club. 

Check out some of my projects and please reach out if you have any questions!
